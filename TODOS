# Claude Credentials Persistence Fix - Testing Instructions

## Background

We've been facing issues with Claude credentials not persisting between container restarts. After analyzing the entrypoint.sh script, we've developed a more robust approach to handling Claude credentials that should fix this problem.

## What Changed

1. Modified credential handling in entrypoint.sh:
   - Using file copies instead of symlinks for Claude credentials
   - Added more error handling and debug logging
   - Fixed permissions on credential files
   - Improved backup/restore of credential files

2. Added storage verification to detect Docker volume issues.

3. Enhanced backup timing to ensure credentials are saved properly.

## Testing Steps

1. Build a new Docker image from the dev branch:
```
docker build -t claudevzzz:testing .
```

2. Run a container with a persistent volume:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v claudevzzz-data:/data claudevzzz:testing
```

3. Authenticate with Claude CLI when prompted:
```
claude auth login
```

4. After authenticating, exit the container shell:
```
exit
```

5. Run a new container using the same image and volume:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v claudevzzz-data:/data claudevzzz:testing
```

6. If the fix is working, the container should start without prompting for Claude authentication again, and you should see "âœ… Claude CLI (found credentials)" in the logs.

## Debugging

If credentials are still not persisting:

1. Check the container logs for more details about what might be happening
2. Verify credential files exist in the right locations:
   - `/data/.claude/` (should contain .credentials.json)
   - `/data/.claude.json` (may exist for some configurations)
3. Check file permissions (should be 600 for .json files and 700 for directories)
4. Ensure the Docker volume is properly mounted and persisting data
